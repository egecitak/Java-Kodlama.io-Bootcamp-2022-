Monolith - N-Layered Architecture:
Data Access: access to the data.
Business: codes about the business.
UI: everything used by the user.
There is an intermediate layer between UI and Business called API.

- If a layer needs access to another layer's class, it should only connect through the
interface (except entities).

JDBC
Hibernate-ORM
JPA

Entities: database objects.
DAO: Data Access Object
